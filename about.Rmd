This site was built by Hannah Koenker, Technical Director at Tropical Health. Both Stata and R were used for analysis and presentation of the findings. Feedback and questions are welcome! You can reach me at hannah AT trophealth DOT com.

<h1>Methods</h1>
Publicly available datasets were downloaded from dhsprogram.com. Datasets were scanned and those containing information on net color and/or preferences for net color were retained. Appropriate survey weights were applied using the "svy" command in Stata and/or the "survey" package in R. Regression results for the results on the homepage were run with the svy: logistic command in Stata.
